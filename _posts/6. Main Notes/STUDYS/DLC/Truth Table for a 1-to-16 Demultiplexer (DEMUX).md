### Truth Table for a 1-to-16 Demultiplexer (DEMUX)

A 1-to-16 DEMUX has one input line \(D\), four control lines \(S3, S2, S1, S0\), and sixteen output lines \(Y0, Y1, Y2, ..... , Y15\). Each output line is selected based on the combination of the control lines, and only one output line is active (equal to the input \(D\)) at a time, while the others are inactive (equal to 0).

Here's the truth table for a 1-to-16 DEMUX:

### Explanation
- **Control Lines (S3, S2, S1, S0)**: These lines determine which output line will be active.
- **Input Line (D)**: This is the input signal that will be routed to one of the output lines based on the control lines.
- **Output Lines (Y0 to Y15)**: Only one output line will be equal to the input \(D\) based on the combination of control lines, while the rest will be 0.

For example:
- When \(S3 = 0\), \(S2 = 0\), \(S1 = 0\), and \(S0 = 0\), \(Y0\) is equal to \(D\).
- When \(S3 = 0\), \(S2 = 0\), \(S1 = 0\), and \(S0 = 1\), \(Y1\) is equal to \(D\).
- ...
- When \(S3 = 1\), \(S2 = 1\), \(S1 = 1\), and \(S0 = 1\), \(Y15\) is equal to \(D\).

This truth table demonstrates how a 1-to-16 DEMUX routes the input signal to one of its 16 outputs based on the binary value represented by the control lines.
