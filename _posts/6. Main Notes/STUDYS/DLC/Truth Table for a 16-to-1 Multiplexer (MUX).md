### Truth Table for a 16-to-1 Multiplexer (MUX)

A 16-to-1 multiplexer (MUX) has sixteen input lines (\(I_0, I_1, \ldots, I_{15}\)), four control lines (\(S_3, S_2, S_1, S_0\)), and one output line (\(Y\)). The output line \(Y\) will be equal to one of the input lines based on the combination of the control lines.

Here's the truth table for a 16-to-1 MUX:

| S3 | S2 | S1 | S0 | Output \(Y\) |
|----|----|----|----|--------------|
|  0 |  0 |  0 |  0 |      \(I_0\)      |
|  0 |  0 |  0 |  1 |      \(I_1\)      |
|  0 |  0 |  1 |  0 |      \(I_2\)      |
|  0 |  0 |  1 |  1 |      \(I_3\)      |
|  0 |  1 |  0 |  0 |      \(I_4\)      |
|  0 |  1 |  0 |  1 |      \(I_5\)      |
|  0 |  1 |  1 |  0 |      \(I_6\)      |
|  0 |  1 |  1 |  1 |      \(I_7\)      |
|  1 |  0 |  0 |  0 |      \(I_8\)      |
|  1 |  0 |  0 |  1 |      \(I_9\)      |
|  1 |  0 |  1 |  0 |     \(I_{10}\)     |
|  1 |  0 |  1 |  1 |     \(I_{11}\)     |
|  1 |  1 |  0 |  0 |     \(I_{12}\)     |
|  1 |  1 |  0 |  1 |     \(I_{13}\)     |
|  1 |  1 |  1 |  0 |     \(I_{14}\)     |
|  1 |  1 |  1 |  1 |     \(I_{15}\)     |

### Explanation
- **Control Lines (S3, S2, S1, S0)**: These lines determine which input line will be selected and forwarded to the output.
- **Input Lines (I0 to I15)**: These are the potential inputs that can be selected based on the control lines.
- **Output Line (Y)**: The selected input line value will appear on this line.

For example:
- When \(S3 = 0\), \(S2 = 0\), \(S1 = 0\), and \(S0 = 0\), \(Y = I_0\).
- When \(S3 = 0\), \(S2 = 0\), \(S1 = 0\), and \(S0 = 1\), \(Y = I_1\).
- When \(S3 = 0\), \(S2 = 0\), \(S1 = 1\), and \(S0 = 0\), \(Y = I_2\).
- ...
- When \(S3 = 1\), \(S2 = 1\), \(S1 = 1\), and \(S0 = 1\), \(Y = I_{15}\).

This truth table shows how the control lines determine which input line is passed through to the output in a 16-to-1 multiplexer.
