The most common image formats used today include:

1. **JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group)**:
    
    - Widely used for photographs and realistic images with continuous tones and color gradients.
    - Supports lossy compression, making file sizes smaller but sacrificing some image quality.
2. **PNG (Portable Network Graphics)**:
    
    - Best for images with sharp details, text, and illustrations.
    - Supports lossless compression, preserving image quality without sacrificing detail.
    - Often used for web graphics (e.g., logos, icons) and images with transparent backgrounds.
3. **GIF (Graphics Interchange Format)**:
    
    - Supports animations and basic transparency (1-bit transparency).
    - Uses lossless compression but with a limited color palette (256 colors), making it less suitable for photographs but good for simple graphics and animations.
4. **TIFF (Tagged Image File Format)**:
    
    - Commonly used in professional environments (e.g., printing, publishing).
    - Supports lossless compression and stores high-quality images with large file sizes.
    - Suitable for images that require preservation of high detail and color accuracy.
5. **BMP (Bitmap)**:
    
    - Stores graphics data in the form of pixels without compression.
    - Generally used in Windows environments and supports lossless image quality.
    - Results in larger file sizes compared to formats with compression.
6. **WebP**:
    
    - Developed by Google, WebP supports both lossy and lossless compression.
    - Designed to improve web performance by reducing file sizes without sacrificing image quality.
    - Growing in popularity for web graphics and images due to its efficient compression algorithms.
7. **SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)**:
    
    - XML-based vector image format that supports interactivity and animation.
    - Scales to any size without losing quality, making it ideal for logos, icons, and graphics on the web.
    - Not a raster format like others on the list; rather, it describes images using geometric shapes and text.
